# CAC-Compression
Optimization for Constant Area Coding compression method using :dna: Gentic Algorithm
## Method 
Genetic Algorithms (GA) optimize the kernel size for compressing binary images. By evaluating different kernel sizes based on compression quality, GA finds the optimal size. It iteratively applies genetic operations, evaluates fitness, and selects individuals until convergence. GA is an effective method to enhance binary image compression by finding the best kernel size.
